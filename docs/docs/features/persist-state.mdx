# Persist State

import index from '!!raw-loader!@site/docs/examples/persist-state.ex';
import { LiveDemo } from '@site/components/LiveDemo';

The `persistState()` function gives you the ability to persist some of the app’s state, by saving it to `localStorage/sessionStorage` or anything that implements the `StorageEngine` API, and restore it after a refresh.

First, you need to install the package by using the CLI command `elf-cli install` and selecting the persist-state package, or via npm:

```bash
npm i @ngneat/elf-persist-state
```

To use it you should call the `persistState()` function, passing the store and the options:

```ts
import { createStore, withProps, select } from '@ngneat/elf';
import {
  persistState,
  localStorageStrategy,
  sessionStorageStrategy,
} from '@ngneat/elf-persist-state';

interface AuthProps {
  user: { id: string } | null;
}

const authStore = createStore({ name }, withProps<AuthProps>({ user: null }));

export const persist = persistState(authStore, {
  key: 'auth',
  storage: localStorageStrategy,
});

export const user$ = authStore.pipe(select((state) => state.user));
```

As the second parameter you should pass a `Options` object, which can be used to define the following:

- `storage`: an Object with `setItem`, `getItem` and `removeItem` method for storing the state (required).
- `source`: a method that receives the store and return what to save from it (by default - the entire store).
- `preStoreInit`: a method that run upon initializing the store with a saved value, used for any required modifications before the value is set.
- `key`: the name under which the store state is saved (by default - the store name plus a `@store` suffix).
- `runGuard` - returns whether the actual implementation should be run. The default is `() => typeof window !== 'undefined'`

<LiveDemo src={index} packages={['persist']} />

<br />
Elf also exposes the `initialized$` observable. This observable emits after Elf initialized
the stores based on the storage's value. For example:

```ts
import { persistState, localStorageStrategy } from '@ngneat/elf-persist-state';

const instance = persistState(todoStore, {
  key: 'todos',
  storage: localStorageStrategy,
});

instance.initialized$.subscribe(console.log);
```

## Async Support

This gives you the option to save a store’s value to a persistent storage, such as indexDB, websql, or any other asynchronous API. Here’s an example that leverages [localForage](https://github.com/localForage/localForage):

```ts
import * as localForage from 'localforage';

localForage.config({
  driver: localForage.INDEXEDDB,
  name: 'myApp',
  version: 1.0,
  storeName: 'auth',
});

export const persist = persistState(authStore, {
  key: 'auth',
  storage: localForage,
});
```

## Excluding keys from the state

The `excludeKeys()` operator can be used to exclude keys from the state:

```ts
import {
  excludeKeys,
  persistState,
  localStorageStrategy,
} from '@ngneat/elf-persist-state';

persistState(todoStore, {
  key: 'todos',
  storage: localStorageStrategy,
  source: () => todoStore.pipe(excludeKeys(['ids', 'entities'])),
});
```
