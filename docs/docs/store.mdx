# The Store

import index from '!!raw-loader!@site/docs/examples/store.ex';
import { LiveDemo } from '@site/components/LiveDemo';

The store takes an object that contains three properties - a `state`, a `name`, and `config`.

:::info

A state is a composition of properties

:::

To create the initial state used by your store call the `createState()` method. This method returns a `state` object and a `config` object. They are then used in the creation of the store:

```ts
import { Store, createState, withProps } from '@ngneat/elf';

interface AuthProps {
  user: { id: string } | null;
}

const { state, config } = createState(withProps<AuthProps>({ user: null }));

const authStore = new Store({ state, name: 'auth', config });
```

The `createState` can accept any number of features which describe the nature of the store. For example:

```ts
const { state, config } = createState(
  withEntities<Todo>(),
  withUIEntities<UIEntity>(),
  withProps<{ foo: string }>({ foo: '' })
);
```

The features can be either one or more of the available features in Elf, or additional features you can create or add from other sources.

## Querying the Store

A store is a `BehaviorSubject`. Therefore, we can subscribe to it to get its initial value and its subsequent values:

```ts
authStore.subscribe((state) => {
  console.log(state);
});
```

### The `select` Operator

Select a slice from the store:

```ts
import { select } from '@ngneat/elf';

const user$ = authStore.pipe(select((state) => state.user));
```

The `select()` operator returns an observable that calls `distinctUntilChanged()` internally, meaning it will only fire when the state changes, i.e., when there is a new reference to the selected state.

We can also query its value **once** without the need to subscribe:

```ts
const state = authstore.getValue();
```

## Updating the Store

To update the store, we can use the `update` method which receives a callback function, which gets the current `state`, and returns a new **immutable** `state`, which will be the new value of the store:

```ts
authStore.update((state) => ({
  ...state,
  user: { id: 'foo' },
}));
```
