# Hooks

Elf allows customizing some of the behavior via `elfHooks`

## registerPreStoreUpdate

Provide a function to modify the store value after reducers has run.

The callback function takes three arguments:

- `currentState` - state before reducers has run
- `nextState` - state after reducers has run
- `storeName` - the name of the store

One scenario when this functionality could be useful is when a developer wants to prevent bugs associated with mutability by freezing the store value during the development:

```ts
import { elfHooks, deepFreeze } from '@ngneat/elf';

if (!environment.production) {
  elfHooks.registerPreStoreUpdate((currentState, nextState, storeName) => {
    return deepFreeze(nextState);
  });
}
```
