# FAQ

## Browser Support

As Elf aims to be light and fast, we compile the code for modern browsers. Let us know if you wish to use Elf in production and require older browser support. 

## What About Akita?

Akita is still actively maintained. Elf is merely another option.
Furthermore, Akita is Datorama driven, and therefore performing significant changes was difficult.
**Elf was created to be more community driven**. See the [comment](https://github.com/ngneat/elf/discussions/5#discussioncomment-1437641) for more information.
